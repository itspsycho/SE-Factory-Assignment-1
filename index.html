        The exposure triangle consists of three variables that adjust how a
        camera captures light: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Together, these
        three elements properly expose a shot. The three variables of the
        exposure triangle are all dependent on each other.

        How does the exposure triangle work? To better understand the exposure
        triangle, lets examine each variable one by one starting with aperture.
        The literal definition of aperture means “opening” or “hole.” The
        aperture of a camera lens is a hole that regulates how much light passes
        through to the film or sensor. When the shutter button of a camera is
        hit, the aperture opens up to a predetermined width and lets in a
        specific amount of light. Aperture works with ISO and shutter speed to
        control exposure. Here is an image of an exposure triangle cheat sheet
        that you can save for reference when shooting your next project.

      <h1 class="block-title">Shutter Speed</h1>
      <p>
        When the shutter button of a camera is pressed, the aperture opens up.
        How long the aperture stays open is determined by the cameras shutter
        speed. Shutter speed controls how long the sensor of the camera is
        exposed to light. Shutter speed is measured in fractions of a second.
        For example, a shutter speed of 1/60 holds the shutter open for one
        sixtieth of one second. The longer the shutter speed is in time the more
        light is let in. If it is shorter in time, less light is let in. Here is
        a video by Phlearn that breaks down shutter speed and how it affects
        exposure.

    <div class="block">
      <h1 class="block-title">ISO</h1>
      <p>
        ISO determines how sensitive a digital cameras sensor reads the light.
        In a film camera, ISO refers to a specific film stocks sensitivity to
        light. With new technology in DSLR cameras, a cameras sensor can adjust
        their ISO and sensitivity to light depending on the available light of a
        shot. ISO is measured in ISO values such as 50, 100, 200, 400, 800,
        1600, 3200, etc. A lower ISO value such as 50 makes a cameras sensor
        less sensitive to light. A higher ISO value such as 1600 makes a cameras
        sensor more sensitive to light. This video tutorial breaks down the
        correlation between ISO values and exposure.

      <h1 class="block-title">Exposing with too much light</h1>
      <p>
        There are pros and cons when shooting in an environment with a lot of
        light, such as an midday exterior shot. The benefit would be that you
        can shoot at your cameras low native ISO allowing for minimal image
        noise and a full dynamic range. However to avoid overexposure in your
        shot, youll need to adjust either your aperture, shutter speed, or both.
        If you are shooting a still photo, you may want to begin with shooting
        at a faster shutter speed to cut down the amount of light coming into
        the camera. This will allow you to control the light without
        compromising your desired aperture and depth of field. For more tips on
        shooting in bright settings, check out the tips in this video by B&H
        Photo.
